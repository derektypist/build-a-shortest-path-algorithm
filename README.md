# Build A Shortest Path Algorithm

Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algorithm.

## Technologies

Uses Python3.  Use of functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a shortest path algorithm.

## Deployment

Copy the code of `main.py` into the text editor.  In terminal type `python3 main.py` to run the code.
